Oracle Finance Module Migration to Apex
We have all worked on the legacy Oracle Finance Module. Now, I plan to migrate it to Oracle Apex as a project. Our team consists of developers at different levelsâ€”starters, juniors, and seniors.

Task 1:

Deploy the script on Oracle Workspace after removing commented lines.
Create an activity log procedure before deployment to ensure smooth integration.
Reach out to me if you face any issues.
Next Steps:

Develop the master form.
Initially, the module will include two forms and three reports (Ledger, Trial Balance, etc.), with further extensions based on our expertise.
